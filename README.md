# NumberRecognition
Hi my name is jordan and this is my first project using a neural network.
As this is my first if you have any suggestions for improvement please let me know.

# Training.py
In this project I utilized the mnist handwritten digits dataset for training the neural network.
To build and train the model I utilized the tensor flow library

# Draw.py
I converted simple black and white 28x28 images to numpy arrays which were then fed into my model to generate a prediction.
